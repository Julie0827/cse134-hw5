# Key Enhancements:

## Contact Form 📝
I made several updates to the contact form to improve its usability. The “Clear” button was removed for simplicity, the character restrictions on the comment field were lifted to allow for more flexibility, and the error messages and character counter were repositioned directly below their respective input fields for better clarity and user guidance.

## My Contact 💌
I made some small but important styling adjustments to the `my-contact` custom element, ensuring the layout looks polished and consistent across all screen sizes for a more professional appearance on both mobile and desktop.

## Search Bar 🔍
Although this write-up focuses on Homework 5, I’d like to briefly mention that in the previous assignment, I implemented a fully functional search bar, which significantly enhanced navigation and user experience by allowing users to search for content across the site.

## 404 Page ⚠️
To enhance user experience, I designed a custom 404 page that replaces the generic error message. When a user navigates to an incorrect URL, the page provides a friendly notification and encourages them to explore the website via the navigation or search bar. This creates a more engaging experience, rather than a typical error screen.

## Hamburger Button 🍔
I made adjustments to the media queries in the header, which includes the logo, navigation links, search bar, theme toggle, and music player. The hamburger button now only appears on mobile screens, enhancing the desktop view by ensuring users can access the links directly without needing to interact with the hamburger button, even when resizing the window.

## PWA 📱
I added a `site.webmanifest` file to lay the foundation for Progressive Web App (PWA) support. This enables the website to function more like a native app on mobile devices, and I plan to enhance its capabilities further with a service worker for offline functionality in the future.

## Search Sidebar 📋
I optimized the performance of the search sidebar by replacing dynamic HTML with a hidden element for the “no results found” message. This change prevents unnecessary image flickering and unnecessary reloads, making the search functionality more seamless and efficient.
